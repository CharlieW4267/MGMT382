    Our Story
    <br>
    Stemming from the agrirucultarly rich Purdue University, 3 students formed Coltivare to aid farmers. Offering initail poridcuts like the geoscanner to the ..., we've done just that. Forutnately the products seen from Coltivare are only an initial look into how farming technology will continue to be changed. Our inspiration comes from our home in Indiana, where agriculture plays a big role in our state.
